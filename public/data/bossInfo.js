  "Iudex Gundyr": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/gundyr.jpg"],
    text: "Once a champion who arrived too late to link the fire, Gundyr is resurrected endlessly as a judge for Unkindled Ash. His hulking armor and halberd make him a formidable foe, and midway through the fight he becomes host to the writhing Pus of Man. Gundyr is resistant to poison and bleed but weak to fire and strike damage, making firebombs and blunt weapons highly effective."
  },
  "Vordt of the Boreal Valley": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/Vordt.jpg"],
    text: "A once-loyal knight transformed into a frost-driven beast, Vordt serves as a corrupted sentinel of the Boreal Valley. His savage charges and frostbite breath freeze unwary travelers.

  },
  "Curse-Rotted Greatwood": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/curse.jpg"],
    text: "This massive, diseased tree houses the curses of countless souls. Its fight revolves around striking pus-filled sacs across its body, leading to grotesque transformations.

  },
  "Crystal Sage": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/crystal.jpg"],
    text: "A master sorcerer draped in flowing robes, the Crystal Sage bombards challengers with soul sorceries and conjured illusions.

  },
  "Deacons of the Deep": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/deacon.jpg"],
    text: "This congregation of clerics serves Aldrich in endless ritual. The battle is against the collective horde, focusing on whichever deacon holds the red aura.

  },
  "Abyss Watchers": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/abyss.jpg"],
    text: "The undead legion sworn to fight the Abyss eventually turned their blades upon one another, consumed by endless bloodlust.

  },
  "High Lord Wolnir": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/lord.jpg"],

  },
  "Old Demon King": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/demon-king.jpg"],
    text: "The final remnant of the chaos demons, this ancient monarch burns with the fading ember of the First Flame. He is resistant to fire but weak to lightning and dark damage, making miracles and sorceries effective choices. His massive firestorms and sweeps punish slow fighters."
  },
  "Pontiff Sulyvan": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/pont.jpg"],

  "Yhorm the Giant": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/yhorm.jpg"],

  "Aldrich, Devourer of Gods": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/aldrich.jpg"],
    text: "Once a holy cleric, Aldrich fell into cannibalism and transformed into a sludge-like horror. He devoured the gods, even consuming Gwyndolin.

  },
  "Ancient Wyvern": {
    imgs: ["/images/bosses/wyvern.jpg"],
